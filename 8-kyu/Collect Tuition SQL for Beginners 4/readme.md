### Collect Tuition (SQL for Beginners #4)

You are working for a local school, and you are responsible for collecting tuition from students. You have a list of all students, some of them have already paid tution and some haven't. Write a select statement to get a list of all students who haven't paid their tuition yet. The list should include all the data available about these students.

students table schema
* name (string)
* age (integer)
* semester (integer)
* mentor (string)
* tuition_received (Boolean)

NOTE: Your solution should use pure SQL. Ruby is used within the test cases to do the actual testing.
